Hello! To open the application please navigate to the directory and then run npm start, this should open a localhost from which you can open a mobile emulator or scan a QR code with your mobile device to open the mobile application using EXPO client.

If I had more time to work on the assignment I would love to handle some edge-case handling and feature implementation! Such as when axios does not return an author, desciption, or image for an article, I could implement logic to have these components not render at all in these cases. I would also like to add a refresh feature, infinite scroll, filters, sharing, etc!

Thanks for the assignment, it was enjoyable!
